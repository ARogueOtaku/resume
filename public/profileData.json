    "aboutMe": "I am a mid-level React developer with 5+ years of experience in building web applications. My passion lies in creating exceptional user experiences through front-end design and layout, while my ability to handle complex features with ease ensures high performance and minimal bugs. I have expertise in React, Redux, GraphQL, React Router, Material UI, and TailwindCSS, which allows me to bring any idea to life. I have also dabbled in back-end development, writing SQL queries and creating basic REST APIs using NodeJS and Express. I love collaborating with others and thrive in a team environment, and I am always eager to explore new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible in web development."
